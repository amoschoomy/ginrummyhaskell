Disclaimer: I'm only responsbile for Player Actions. Code Skeleton is provided by Monash University.


Things to do:

1) Figure out how to corporate changes from opponents actions into memory
2) Complete the two remaining functions [DONE]
3) Figure out how to check knocks and gin accurately [GIN NOT TESTED YET]

5) Reset Memory after each turn
