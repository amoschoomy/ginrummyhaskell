Gin Rummy based on Haskell.

Disclaimer: I'm only responsbile for Player Actions. Code Skeleton is provided by Monash University.


Things to do:

1) Figure out how to corporate changes from opponents actions into memory [DONE]
2) Complete the two remaining functions [DONE]
3) Figure out how to check knocks and gin accurately [DONE]
4) Figure out what to return as memory in PlayFunc [DONE]
5) Reset Memory after each turn [DONE]


Important Note: Game 'AI' perform terribly, something needs to be done when choosing which cards to drop.
Can't figure out the optimal card to drop.
