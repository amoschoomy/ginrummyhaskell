Gin Rummy based on Haskell.

Disclaimer: I'm only responsbile for Player Actions. Code Skeleton is provided by Monash University.


Things to do:

1) Figure out how to corporate changes from opponents actions into memory
2) Complete the two remaining functions [ONE LEFT]
3) Figure out how to check knocks and gin accurately
4) Figure out what to return as memory in PlayFunc
